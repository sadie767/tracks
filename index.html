        <h2>What is Ruby?</h2>
        <p>Ruby is a programming language focused on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. The Ruby programming language is most commonly used with the Ruby on Rails framework. Ruby and Rails are typically
          used by younger companies and startups, especially for building interactive web applications. Companies using Ruby and Rails who have hired Epicodus graduates include New Relic, LivingSocial, and SpendWell.</p>
        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
        <p>After establishing solid programming fundamentals in the Introduction to Programming course, this course introduces students to the Ruby framework and gives them more difficult problems to solve and a more advanced set of tools to solve them with.
          It also establishes the foundations for learning real-world technologies used by programmers on the job. The outline of topics for this course is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Week 1: Behavior-Driven Development
          <li>Week 2: Onject-Oriented Ruby
          <li>Week 3: Database Basics
          <li>Week 4: Advanced Databases with Active Record
          <li>Week 5: Group Projects
        </ul>
